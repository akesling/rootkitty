* Status should probably be a line that, when clicked, expands if there's more
  text, instead of always being an outlined "pane"
* Provide some facility for listing against the current directory that's
  referenced by the scan note and seeing a diff now vs. when the scan occurred
* Provide the ability to drop into a shell in a given displayed directory or
  parent of a file
* Display how large the scan itself is on disk
* Add the ability to sort by size, name, etc.
