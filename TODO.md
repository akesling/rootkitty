* Status should probably be a line that, when clicked, expands if there's more
text, instead of always being an outlined "pane"
* Provide some facility for listing against the current directory that's
referenced by the scan note and seeing a diff now vs. when the scan occurred
* Add a way to delete previous scans
* Display how large the scan itself is on disk
* Make "o" synonymous with "z"
